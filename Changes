This file documents the revision history for Perl extension PAPS.

0.010  Sun Jan 22 21:34:17 2012 -0500
  New features:
    - Added a new field, "year" for works.  This should contain the year that
      that work was released.  This field is optional.  A text field for this
      datum is not present when creating a new work, but is available when
      editing a work.
    - Added a new "graph2" page at /works/graph2 that uses a newew module as
      the GraphViz interface.  This module has more features, such as allowing
      more complex node labels.  The labels on this page display the work
      title and year (if defined) on the first row, authors on the second, and
      categories and tags on the third and fourth lines.  The categories and
      tags are truncated to 60 characters so longer lists do not make the node
      wider.
    - On a work's details page, display a graph showing that work, its
      references, and what references it.  This graph uses the newer "graph2"
      module.
    - Updated to support schema changes in PAPS::Database::papsdb::Schema
      version 0.004.

0.009  Mon Dec 26 21:59:50 2011 -0500
  New features:
    - Added support for References and Work References.  The sidebar has links
      to pages that list all references or allow editing references.
    - The details page for a work lists all references that work references,
      as well as all works that reference that work.  The edit page for a work
      allows editing existing references (what works that work references), as
      well as adding new references.
    - Added support for Source Category Types, Source Categories, Source Tag
      Types, and Source Tags.  The sidebar has links to pages to list, create,
      and edit these objects, as appropriate.  All of these objects are
      related to specific Sources.
    - The Source details page lists all related Source Category Types, Source
      Categories, Source Tag Types, and Source Tags.  The edit page for
      Sources allows creating new and editing current Source Category Types
      and Source Tag Types.
    - The Works details page lists all associated Source Categories and Source
      Tags.  The edit page for Works allows creating new related categories
      and tags.  These can not currently be edited from the Works page, as all
      of the fields in these tables are part of the primary keys for those
      tables.
    - The list of authors on the Works details page are now sorted by author
      position.
    - The list of references on the Works details and edit pages are now
      sorted by chapter then rank.
    - Change the default layout for the works graph so the resulting image is
      smaller.
    - Updated the works graph to use a random start for the initial work's
      position, so the graph is different each time it is drawn.
    - The nodes in the works graph are now colored based on each work's
      references.  If the total number of references is not known, the node is
      given a red border.  If the total number is known but not all are added,
      it is given a yellow border.  Otherwise, the node is given a black
      border.

  New features:
    - Added support for Work Sources.  The sidebar has links to pages to

      Information about a Source can be edited using the Edit link on that
      Source's details page.
    - Sources can be added to a Work on that Work's details page.

      button on this page to save changes to the current work, and a Cancel
      button to return to that work's details page and not enact any changes.
    - The page to create a work now includes a dropdown box to indicate what
      type of work the new work is.

    - Database schema is now loaded from an external extension,

          details page provides a list of that person's works.  Each list has
          a link to go to the referenced work or person's details page.
        - Pages with works and people lists now also includes a link to that
          record's details page.

        - List of people includes name and works.
        - There is a very basic page to create new works, but it is not linked

          people with works, or edit people or works.
