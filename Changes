        - Added a page to create new people.
        - Added links to people and works creation pages in the naviation bar.
        - Added pages to view details about a work or a person.  The work
          details page provides a list of that work's authors, and the person
          details page provides a list of that person's works.  Each list has
          a link to go to the referenced work or person's details page.
        - Pages with works and people lists now also includes a link to that
          record's details page.

        - Set of a few very simple pages available.
        - Can view the list of people and works.
        - List of works includes title, subtitle, edition, author(s), and DOI.
        - List of people includes name and works.
        - There is a very basic page to create new works, but it is not linked
          to directly, and there is no way to create new people, associate
          people with works, or edit people or works.
