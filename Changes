0.011  Sun Feb 26 14:08:42 2012 -0500
  New features:
    - Added new controller Users for the users table.  Functionality includes
      viewing a list of users, creating a new user, and updating user
      information (sans password)
    - Added views for supported Users actions.
    - Added support for logging in and logging out.  Corresponding actions in
      the Users controller check the entered user name and password against
      what is in the users table and, if successful, sets the user as logged
      in.  After trying to log in, he is brought to a page that informs he
      whether he has logged in successfully or not.
    - Added dependencies for authentication modules, and added the
      Authentication plugin in the list of plugins in PAPS.pm.
    - Added support for sessions.  Included dependencies for the required
      modules and the plugins to the Catalyst plugin list.
    - Logged in users can add work metadata from the edit works page.  This
      metadata includes whether the user has read the work, when the user read
      the work, and ratings of how well the user understood and "approved" of
      the work.  This metadata is displayed on a work's details page if he is
      logged in.  If a user is not logged in, the works details page will
      inform him he can modify his metadata on the work if he logs in, and a
      link to the login page is provided.
    - Display and make editable the rank for source categories (added in
      PAPS::Database::papsdb::Schema 0.005).
    - Display and make editable the new author metadata fields for work
      authors, including the literal text used for an author's name and the
      authors affiliation (new columns added in PAPS::Database::papsdb::Schema
      0.005).
    - A work's source categories can now be edited, meaning the name of the
      source category can be changed after it has been added to a work.
    - If a user is logged in, include his work metadata in the nodes in the
      GraphViz2 graphs (on a work's details page and on the graph2 page).
      Placeholder values are provided ("Never" or "N/A") if the user has not
      entered information for that work.
    - Color a work node blue in the GraphViz2 graphs if the current user has
      read it.
  Bug fixes:
    - Added missing dependencies for GraphViz2 and File::Temp modules.

0.010  Sun Jan 22 21:34:17 2012 -0500
  New features:
    - Added a new field, "year" for works.  This should contain the year that
      that work was released.  This field is optional.  A text field for this
      datum is not present when creating a new work, but is available when
      editing a work.
    - Added a new "graph2" page at /works/graph2 that uses a newew module as
      the GraphViz interface.  This module has more features, such as allowing
      more complex node labels.  The labels on this page display the work
      title and year (if defined) on the first row, authors on the second, and
      categories and tags on the third and fourth lines.  The categories and
      tags are truncated to 60 characters so longer lists do not make the node
      wider.
    - On a work's details page, display a graph showing that work, its
      references, and what references it.  This graph uses the newer "graph2"
      module.
    - Updated to support schema changes in PAPS::Database::papsdb::Schema
      version 0.004.

0.009  Mon Dec 26 21:59:50 2011 -0500
  New features:
    - Added support for References and Work References.  The sidebar has links
      to pages that list all references or allow editing references.
    - The details page for a work lists all references that work references,
      as well as all works that reference that work.  The edit page for a work
      allows editing existing references (what works that work references), as
      well as adding new references.
    - Added support for Source Category Types, Source Categories, Source Tag
      Types, and Source Tags.  The sidebar has links to pages to list, create,
      and edit these objects, as appropriate.  All of these objects are
      related to specific Sources.
    - The Source details page lists all related Source Category Types, Source
      Categories, Source Tag Types, and Source Tags.  The edit page for
      Sources allows creating new and editing current Source Category Types
      and Source Tag Types.
    - The Works details page lists all associated Source Categories and Source
      Tags.  The edit page for Works allows creating new related categories
      and tags.  These can not currently be edited from the Works page, as all
      of the fields in these tables are part of the primary keys for those
      tables.
    - The list of authors on the Works details page are now sorted by author
      position.
    - The list of references on the Works details and edit pages are now
      sorted by chapter then rank.
    - Change the default layout for the works graph so the resulting image is
      smaller.
    - Updated the works graph to use a random start for the initial work's
      position, so the graph is different each time it is drawn.
    - The nodes in the works graph are now colored based on each work's
      references.  If the total number of references is not known, the node is
      given a red border.  If the total number is known but not all are added,
      it is given a yellow border.  Otherwise, the node is given a black
      border.

0.008  Sun Aug 23 17:48:02 2011 -0400
  New features:
    - Added support for Work Sources.  The sidebar has links to pages to
      create new Sources and list the existing Sources.  The details page for
      Sources includes a table of the Works that can be found in that Source.
      Information about a Source can be edited using the Edit link on that
      Source's details page.
    - Sources can be added to a Work on that Work's details page.
    - Added an edit page for People, to allow changing the data about People.
      The details page for a Person has a link to the edit page.

  New features:
    - Changed the "Edit" button on the Work details page to a hyperlink.
    - The Work edit page now has tables to edit existing references and
      authors and to add new references and authors.
    - The tables of references on the Work details page now includes what type
      of reference each records is.
    - Added a new "graph" page at /works/graph that displays a graph
      representing the Works in the database, and the references between them.
  Bug fixes:
    - When creating a new Work, the selected Work Type is now used.

0.006  Sat Aug 13 21:25:10 2011 -0400
  New features:
    - The work details page includes lists of works that work references and
      works that reference that work.
    - The work details page and the works list page includes the type of each
      work (paper, textbook, etc.).
    - Added a page to edit the information about a work.  This page can be
      accessed via a button on each work's details page.  There is a Submit
      button on this page to save changes to the current work, and a Cancel
      button to return to that work's details page and not enact any changes.
    - The page to create a work now includes a dropdown box to indicate what
      type of work the new work is.

0.005  Sun Aug 7 19:13:34 2011 -0400
  New features:
    - Database schema is now loaded from an external extension,
      PAPS::Database::papsdb::Schema.  This schema includes support for
      multiple new features, including categories, tags, work metadata,
      sources, and users.

0.004  Sun Aug 7 19:05:25 2011 -0400
  New features:
    - In the details for a Person, the type of each work in his list of works
      is now properly included.
    - Added schema information for metaworks and work references.

0.003  2011-01-08 22:41:27 -0400
        - Added a page to create new people.
        - Added links to people and works creation pages in the naviation bar.
        - Added pages to view details about a work or a person.  The work
          details page provides a list of that work's authors, and the person
          details page provides a list of that person's works.  Each list has
          a link to go to the referenced work or person's details page.
        - Pages with works and people lists now also includes a link to that
          record's details page.

0.002  2011-01-30 14:38:40 -0500
        - Set of a few very simple pages available.
        - Can view the list of people and works.
        - List of works includes title, subtitle, edition, author(s), and DOI.
        - List of people includes name and works.
        - There is a very basic page to create new works, but it is not linked
          to directly, and there is no way to create new people, associate
          people with works, or edit people or works.
