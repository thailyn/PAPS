The script to run the built-in server is scripts/paps_server.pl.  This is
perfectly fine for testing and situations with one or few users.  Include the
'-r' argument for the server to restart when the module's files (Models or
Controllers, etc., but not templates) changes:

$ scripts/paps_server.pl -r

If the environment variable DBIC_TRACE is set, DBIC (or is it Catalyst?) will
include all queries to the database in the log messages.  This can be set
globally, or for a single command.  For the latter, use the following command:

$ DBIC_TRACE=1 scripts/paps_server.pl -r

There are also options or flags to set the server in debug mode, which is
probably the preferable way to turn on the debug setting, as the application
should not be deployed in debug mode, particularly for security reasons.  I
have not needed to do this yet, not having a production version yet, so I do
not know how to do this exactly.

Also, there is a flag to set on certain testing flags.  Again, I have not
needed to do this and thus do not know the command offhand.  Check Test::Most
or the Catalyst book for more information.
